Q1:
Overall, the code implements Locality Sensitive Hashing for approximate nearest neighbor search on the 
CIFAR-10 dataset. It utilizes LSH to efficiently retrieve nearest neighbors for query images based on their 
features, facilitating fast similarity search in high-dimensional feature space. Following are the five 
techniques/functions that are used to perform LSH.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
➢ Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset stored in the specified directory. It loads images and their 
corresponding labels from the dataset directory.
➢ Preprocesses the loaded images by resizing them, converting to grayscale, computing 
histograms, performing edge detection, and extracting features. It returns a feature matrix 
where each row represents the features of an image.
Visualization:
➢ Visualizes the preprocessed images, grayscale images, edges, and color histograms for the first 
five images in the dataset.
➢ CV2 library used for grayscale imaging and canny edge detection filter used as it is the best filter 
for detecting edges. 
➢ Color histograms for red, green and blue also displayed.
LSH Class: 
➢ Init: Initializes the LSH parameters including the number of hash tables (number of tables), the 
number of hash functions per table (number of functions), the number of buckets per table 
(number of buckets), and the dimensionality of the feature vectors (number of dimensions). It 
also initializes the projection matrices for each table and the hash tables themselves.
➢ Projection matrix: Generates a random projection matrix for each table. These matrices are 
used to project high-dimensional feature vectors onto lower-dimensional space.
➢ Hash function: Computes the hash value of a vector using a given projection matrix. This hash 
value is used to index into the hash table.
➢ Hash vector: Hashes a given vector into all hash tables. It computes the hash value for each 
table and updates the corresponding hash table with the hashed vector.
➢ Query: Executes a query on the LSH data structure. It hashes the query vector into each table, 
retrieves the candidates from each table, and aggregates the results.
Helper Functions:
➢ Computes the Euclidean distance between two vectors.
➢ Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors.
Execution:
➢ Loading and Preprocessing Data: Loads the CIFAR-10 training dataset, preprocesses the images, 
and extracts features from them.
➢ LSH Instantiation and Population: Instantiates the LSH object with specified parameters and 
populates the LSH tables with the training data.
➢ Query Execution: Selects a subset of images from the training set as queries, executes queries 
against LSH tables, and retrieves nearest neighbors using both Euclidean distance and cosine 
similarity.
The implementation employs Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), a technique adept at approximate nearest 
neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. LSH is particularly suited for scenarios like image retrieval, 
where traditional methods face scalability issues due to the curse of dimensionality. By dividing the 
feature space into hash buckets using multiple hash functions across tables, LSH efficiently indexes data, 
increasing the likelihood of similar data points being hashed into the same bucket. This approach 
drastically reduces the search space, enabling faster retrieval of approximate nearest neighbors while 
maintaining reasonable accuracy.
Furthermore, the choice of both Euclidean distance and cosine similarity metrics for evaluating nearest 
neighbors offers versatility in similarity measurement. Euclidean distance provides a straightforward 
measure of geometric distance between vectors, while cosine similarity is effective in capturing the 
directional relationship between vectors, irrespective of their magnitude. This combination allows for a 
comprehensive exploration of the similarity landscape, catering to diverse use cases and data 
characteristics prevalent in image datasets like CIFAR-10. Overall, this implementation leverages LSH's 
efficiency and the versatility of similarity metrics to facilitate effective image retrieval in high-dimensional 
spaces.

Overview:
The provided code implements Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for approximate nearest neighbor search 
on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The application integrates LSH with a Flask web application to provide a userfriendly interface for image retrieval and analysis. The implementation consists of several components, 
including data loading and preprocessing, LSH integration, Flask routes, HTML templates, and 
visualization.
Flask Application (app.py):
• Initialization: Initializes the Flask application and configures routes and settings.
• Routes: Defines routes for different functionalities, including the home page, form submission, 
and image upload.
• File Upload: Handles file uploads from the user interface and saves uploaded images to the 
server.
• LSH Integration: Integrates LSH functionality for image retrieval and similarity search.
• Query Execution: Executes LSH queries based on user input and displays results on the web 
interface.
• Error Handling: Implements error handling to manage exceptions and provide appropriate 
feedback to users.
HTML Templates:
• Index HTML (index.html): Provides the main interface for users to interact with the application. 
It allows users to upload images and initiate similarity search queries.
• Similar Images HTML (similar_images.html): Displays the results of similarity search queries. It 
shows the uploaded image and a list of similar images retrieved using LSH.
• Error HTML (error.html): Renders error messages to users in case of invalid inputs or other 
errors.
Execution:
• User Interaction: Users interact with the web interface by uploading images and initiating 
similarity search queries.
• Server Processing: The Flask server receives user requests, processes uploaded images, executes 
LSH queries, and generates responses.
• Results Display: The results of similarity search queries are displayed on the web interface using 
HTML templates, providing users with visual feedback on image similarity.
Conclusion:
The integration of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with a Flask web application facilitates efficient image 
retrieval and similarity search in the CIFAR-10 dataset. By combining LSH's scalability and fast query 
execution with a user-friendly interface, the application enables users to explore and analyze image data 
interactively. The seamless interaction between users and the application, coupled with the backend 
processing powered by LSH, demonstrates the innovative application of LSH in image processing and 
analysis
